# Cheat Sheet [(Install Part 3)](https://youtu.be/TMA7nu9KCEQ)

The following sections present a list of key-bindings and features which have been included in the present configuration.
Although I take my target audience to be academics looking to write papers in LaTeX and take notes in Markdown, I will not attempt to provide [resources for learning LaTeX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhmkLrOjLsw) or [Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpAJMSS8pvs&t=574s).
Similarly, if you are looking for the bindings which come default in Vim, then you might check this [resource](https://vim.rtorr.com) out.
I will provide links to associated tutorial videos throughout, omitting mention of the standard Vim commands which have mostly been preserved.
For configuration instructions, see the installation instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config/blob/master/README.md) as well as the [(Install Part 1)](https://youtu.be/JVIcU9ePtVE) video on YouTube.
If you are looking for information specifically about using Git, you can find a number of resources in the [LearningGit.md](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config/blob/master/LearningGit.md) file that I've included.
I will also provide links to further resources for learning Vim below.

# [Learning Vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyEPY6xFhs0&t=2s)

NeoVim maintains the same modes, key-bindings, and conventions as Vim and Vi which go back as far as the late 70s.
With some some practice, these conventions provide an extremely powerful and efficient way to edit text documents, making up the core functionality which NeoVim has to offer.
Learning to use NeoVim is comparable to learning how to touch-type: it will take a concerted effort over a short period of time to get a good foundation from which mastery can slowly be cultivated over the years to come.
However, even with just the foundations, NeoVim offers a significant increase in efficiency, well worth the initial investment.
See the introduction [(Demo Part 1)](https://youtu.be/pYNvDkB0iRk) for related discussion, as well as the following resources for learning to use NeoVim.

- [Detailed Guide](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/) Nice overview.
- [OpenVim](https://www.openvim.com/) Free interactive Vim tutorial.
- [VimAdventure](https://vim-adventures.com/) Free game to practice basic Vim commands.
- [Vim Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XtNXutVto) A guided tour through `vimtutor`.
- [Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3o4l4GVLW0&t=1s) Short tutorial video series.
- [Orienting Remarks](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html) Learning Vim is like learning to touch-type.
- [Another List](https://blog.joren.ga/tools/vim-learning-steps) By no means the only other list of links for learning Vim.
- [Pure Zeal](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-adept/) Nor is this the only sermon on the virtues of Vim and its subtleties.

I have not made any changes to the conventions which come standard with NeoVim, as there is no need to reinvent the wheel.
Rather, what follows is a minimal number of extensions to the functionality provided by NeoVim.

# [Mappings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cex2z74f9-4)

Which-Key is triggered by the space bar, and will bring up a range of key-bindings with associated names.
Accordingly, I will focus attention on the mappings included in `~/.config/nvim/keys/mappings.vim`, though I will mention some of the Which-Key bindings in discussing plugins in the following section.

## _Line Movements_ [(Install Part 3)](https://youtu.be/TMA7nu9KCEQ)

- **Drag lines**: the commands `alt+j` and `alt+k` will drag the selected lines up or down in visual, normal, or insert mode, where indenting is adjusted automatically.
- **Better indenting**: the `<` and `>` keys will adjust indents in both normal and visual mode.
- **Display line movements**: in either normal or visual mode, `shift+j` and `shift+k` will vertically navigate displayed lines as opposed to numbered lines, whereas `shift+h` and `shift+l` will move to the beginning or end of the displayed line, respectively.
- **Easy motion**: use `ctrl+f` to move within the displayed part of the open buffer.

## _Windows, Buffers, and Panes_ [(Install Part 2)](https://youtu.be/Xvu1IKEpO0M)

- **Manage windows**: use `<ctrl+space>c` to create a new window, and `<ctrl+space>k` to kill the current window (make sure that all processes have been ended, for instance by closing NeoVim with `<space>q`).
- **Switch windows**: use `<ctrl+space>n` and `<ctrl+space>p` to cycle through open windows.
- **Switch buffers**: use `<bs>` and `<shift+tab>` to cycle though the open buffers.
- **Navigate panes**: use `<ctrl>h/j/k/l` to switch focus between buffers.
- **Resize panes**: use `<alt>h/l` to horizontally resize the buffer in focus.
- **Previous word**: use `E` to go to the end of the previous word.

## _Commands_ [(Install Part 3)](https://youtu.be/TMA7nu9KCEQ)[(Config Part 6)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtkBoVWeipk)

- **Save and Quit**: use `<space>w` to save buffer, and `<space>q` to save and quite all buffers.
- **Copy**: use `Y` to yank to end of line.
- **Comment**: in normal mode or visually mode, use `ctrl+\ ` to toggle whether the lines in question are commented out.
- **Spelling**: use `ctrl+s` to search alternatives to misspelled word.
- **Help**: use `alt+m` to open Help for the word under the cursor.
- **Multiple Cursors**: use `ctrl+n` to select the word under the cursor or after visually selecting text, where repeating `ctrl+n` will select the next occurrences of that word, `ctrl+x` will skip the current selected occurrence, and `ctrl+p` will deselect the current occurrence and go back to the previous occurrence of that word. Note that by releasing `ctrl` and `n` and `N` work as usual. Additionally, left/right clicking with the mouse while holding down `ctrl` will add a cursor/select-word.
- **Terminal**: use `ctrl+t` to toggle the terminal window in NeoVim.
- **Citation**: use `<CR>` to lookup bib entry under the cursor, giving you the option of viewing or editing the bib data, opening the file, etc.
- **Annotations**: use `<space>ma` to generate annotations for file under the cursor.
- **Bib Export**: use `<space>ab` to generate local bibliography from all citations present in the document.

## _Zathura (Linux)_ [(Demo Part 2)](https://youtu.be/KGqrpnxoDxw)

- **Index**: use `<space>` to toggle the index.
- **Zoom**: use `shift+k` and `shift+j` to zoom in and out, respectively.
- **Print**: use `p` to print.
- **Normal Mode**: use `w` to remove coloration.
- **Sync**: use `ctrl+[right click]` on a line in the pdf once it has been generated by Vimtex in order to highlight the corresponding line in NeoVim. For syncing in the other direction, use `<space>p` to highlight active line in the pdf.
  - NOTE: Zathura will have to have been started by the NeoVim instances you are currently using for syncing to work. To reset sync, close Zathura and regenerate the pdf via `<space>b` or `<space>p` if building is complete or already turned on.

## _Skim (Mac)_ [(Demo Part 2)](https://youtu.be/KGqrpnxoDxw)

- **Sync**: use `cmd+shift+[right click]` on a line in the pdf once it has been generated by Vimtex in order to highlight the corresponding line in NeoVim. For syncing in the other direction, use `<space>p` to highlight active line in the pdf.
  - NOTE: Skim will have to have been started by the NeoVim instances you are currently using for syncing to work. To reset sync, close Skim and regenerate the pdf via `<space>b` or `<space>p` if building is complete or already turned on.

## _GitHub Cli_ [(Git Part 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM_Mwp7R_rk&t=198s)

- **Explorer**: use `<space>e` to open the file explorer, navigating with `j/k`, opening and closing directories with `h/l` adding directories with `shift+a`, adding files with `a`, opening files with `Enter` or `shift+x`, and opening help with `?`.
- **File Manager**: use `<space>vv` to open [vifm](https://github.com/vifm/vifm) (must instal separately).
